*** Brief introduction: ***

This tool can be used to induce the suffix array of a text file from its BWT.

bwt-to-sa firstly indexes the bwt using a succinct wavelet-tree based data structure. Once the bwt is indexed, the tool traverses it n/bufsize times, where bufsize is the size of the SA addresses. Each time the bwt is traversed, the buffer is filled with bufsize SA entries, from the (i*bufsize)-th to the ((i+1)*bufsize -1)-th (where i is the iteration number).

by default, bufsize = n/(log n * log s)

INPUT FORMAT: the bwt file is assumed to be the bwt of the input file, with a 0x0 byte (text terminator) appearing only once inside the file.

*** Complexity ***

n = input length, s = alphabet size

SPACE:	O(n * log s + bufsize*log n) bits. default : O(n * log s)

TIME:	O(n * log s * n/bufsize). default: O(n log n)

*** Compile ***

In the bwt-to-sa/ directory, just execute

> make clean; make

The executable "bwt-to-sa" will be created in the BWTIL/ main folder.

*** Execute ***

In the BWTIL/ directory, execute

> ./bwt-to-sa

to display info about the tool usage.
