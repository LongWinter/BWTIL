Welcome to the succinct FM-index data structure!

*** Brief introduction: ***

This is a version of the popular alphabet-friendly FM index, but without compression. The index occupies space close to the uncompressed text (succinct space).

*** Compile ***

In the sFM-index/ directory, just execute

> make clean; make

The executable "sFM-index" will be created in the BWTIL/ main folder.

*** Notes ***

please note that, due to the particular suffix array library employed, the builtin construction of the BWT can currently handle only texts shorter than 2^31 characters. We are working to integrate more powerful BWT-construction libraries in our software.
