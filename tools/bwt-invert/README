*** Brief introduction: ***

This tool can be used to invert a BWT file.

bwt-invert operates building a (wavelet-tree based) succinct index (n+o(n) bytes) over the bwt file. This index is then used to navigate backwards the bwt in order to invert it and reconstruct the original text.

INPUT FORMAT: the bwt file is assumed to be a valid bwt of some text file, with a 0x0 byte (text terminator) appearing only once inside it.

*** Compile ***

In the bwt-invert/ directory, just execute

> make clean; make

The executable "bwt-invert" will be created in the BWTIL/ main folder.

*** Execute ***

In the BWTIL/ directory, execute

> ./bwt-invert
