 ************************************************************* WARNING : *********************************************************

	the tool is still under development!!! at the moment, cw.bwt works BUT very inefficient data structures are used!!!
	DO NOT use the tool on large files!

*** Brief introduction: ***

cw-bwt builds the BWT of a text (ASCII) file, using an amount of RAM comparable with the size of the compressed text. The algorithm exploits the partitioning induced by the length-k contexts to reduce the size of internal dynamic data structures used. As a result, for certain text distributions (nearly uniform) cw-bwt is optimal in both time and space.

*** Complexity ***

n = input length
Hk = k-th order entropy of the text, where k = log_s( n/log^2 n ) - 1 (Hk <= log s, where s is the alphabet size)

SPACE

	n * Hk + o(n * Hk)	(compressed succinct space)

TIME

Average-case: uniform input texts (eg. DNA) : 

	O(n * Hk)	(a factor Hk from optimal)

Worst-case: Happens if the text has large (O(n)) length-k contexts; notice, however, that in this case the text is also highly compressible (Hk is small)

	O( n * log n * Hk )	(a factor log n * Hk from optimal)

*** Compile ***

In the cw-bwt/ directory, just execute

> make clean; make

The executable "cw-bwt" will be created in the BWTIL/ main folder.

*** Execute ***

In the BWTIL/ directory, execute

> ./cw-bwt

to display info about the tool usage.
