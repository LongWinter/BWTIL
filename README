 ***   Brief introduction   ***


The BWTIL library offers a set of tools to deal with bwt-based text indexes. The library is specifically designed to deal with huge files (which means up to 2^64 characters) and implements space-and-time efficient algorithms and data structures to offer good performances. BWTIL comes with some sample programs and a set of C++ objects, among which you can find static and dynamic bitvectors, Huffman-compressed dynamic strings, partial sums, Huffman trees, static wavelet trees, the dB-hash data structure and a succinct wavelet-tree based FM index. The available executables (to date) are:

 >> dB-hash : an implementation of the dB-hash data structure (see tools/dB-hash/README)
 
 >> sFM-index : an implementation of a succinct (uncompressed) FM-index (see tools/sFM-index/README)

 >> cw-bwt (work in progress) : a novel context-wise bwt construction algorithm (see tools/cw-bwt/README)
 
 >> bwt-check : check consistency of a BWT file (see tools/bwt-check/README)
 
 >> bwt-to-sa : build the Suffix Array from a BWT file (see tools/bwt-to-sa/README)
 
 >> sa-to-bwt : build the BWT from a suffix array file (see tools/sa-to-bwt/README)
 
 >> bwt-invert : invert a BWT file to reconstruct the original text (see tools/bwt-invert/README)


 ***   Compile   ***

To compile all the executables, run

> make

or (for clang++)

> CXX=clang++ make

in the main BWTIL/ directory. To compile the executables individually, execute (in the BWTIL/ directory)

> make tool_name

or (for clang++)

> CXX=clang++ make tool_name

where tool_name is one of dB-hash, cw-bwt, bwt-check, bwt-to-sa, sa-to-bwt, bwt-invert, sFM-index.

Alternatively, move to the desired tool directory BWTIL/tools/tool_name and execute make.

 ***   Test   ***


The folder BWTIL/data/plain/ contains some small example files to test the library. All files have been obtained taking the first 1M characters from the sample files of the pizza&chili text collection (http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/).


 *** Some examples ***


After compiling, in the main BWTIL/ directory run

> ./cw-bwt data/plain/sources.1MB data/bwt/sources.1MB.bwt 2

To build the BWT of the text data/plain/sources.1MB. The BWT will be saved in data/bwt/sources.1MB.bwt

now run

> ./bwt-check data/bwt/sources.1MB.bwt data/plain/sources.1MB

to test the correctness of the BWT file just created. Alternatively, run

> ./bwt-invert data/bwt/sources.1MB.bwt data/plain/sources.1MB_copy

to invert the BWT and check that the two files data/plain/sources.1MB and data/plain/sources.1MB_copy are indeed identical (for example, using diff).

Now that we have the BWT of data/plain/sources.1MB, we can build its suffix array. Run

> ./bwt-to-sa data/bwt/sources.1MB.bwt data/SA/sources.1MB.sa

The suffix array of data/plain/sources.1MB will be stored in data/SA/sources.1MB.sa

If we want to check the consistency of the SA, we can simply convert it back to a BWT with

> ./sa-to-bwt data/SA/sources.1MB.sa data/plain/sources.1MB data/bwt/sources.1MB_copy.bwt

And check with bwt-check the consistency of data/bwt/sources.1MB_copy.bwt against the plain text file data/plain/sources.1MB.

To search the occurrences of a pattern in a text file with the dB-hash data structure, first create the index (in the example, pattern length is 20):

> ./dB-hash build data/plain/sources.1MB 20

Then, to search for the occurrencies of the pattern of length 20 "static unsigned long", run

> ./dB-hash search data/plain/sources.1MB.dbh "static unsigned long"

To search the occurrences of a pattern in a text file with the sFM-index data structure, first create the index:

> ./sFM-index build data/plain/sources.1MB

Then, to search for the occurrencies of the pattern "static unsigned long", run

> ./sFM-index search data/plain/sources.1MB.sfm "static unsigned long"
