 ***   Brief introduction   ***


BWTIL is a library which aims to offer a set of (hopefully useful!) tools to deal with bwt-based text indexes. The library is specifically designed to deal with huge files (which means up to 2^64 characters) and implements space-and-time efficient algorithms and data structures to offer the best performances. BWTIL comes with some sample programs and a set of C++ objects, among which you can find static and dynamic bitvectors, compressed dynamic strings, partial sums, Huffman tree, static wavelet trees, dB-hash data structure. The available executables (to date) are:

 >> dB-hash : an implementation of the dB-hash data structure (see tools/dB-hash/README)
 >> cw-bwt (work in progress) : a novel context-wise bwt construction algorithm (see tools/cw-bwt/README)
 >> bwt-check (work in progress) : check consistency of bwt-files (see tools/bwt-check/README)


 ***   Compile   ***


To compile all the executables, execute

> make

in the main BWTIL/ directory. To compile the executables individually, execute (in the example, the dB-hash tool)

> make dB-hash
